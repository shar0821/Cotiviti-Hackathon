# RAG Application for Research Paper Analysis

## Overview

This document outlines a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to assist researchers in reading and analyzing scientific papers. 
The application leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to provide intelligent summaries, answer questions, and extract key insights from research papers.

## Features

- **PDF Parsing**: Ability to extract text from PDF files of research papers.
- **Abstract Generation**: Produce concise abstracts for quick overview.
- **Context-Aware QA**: Answer specific questions about the paper's content.
- **Section Summaries**: Provide summaries for key sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion).

## Technical Architecture

### Backend

- **Document Processing**: PyPDF2 for PDF parsing.
- **Embedding Generation**: LlamaIndex and Langchain for creating semantic embeddings and Vector Stores.
- **LLM Integration**: Hugging Face open source models to implement LLMs.

### Frontend

- **Web Interface**: Streamlit for rapid prototyping and deployment.

### Data Flow

1. User uploads a research paper (PDF format).
2. Backend processes the PDF, extracts text and metadata.
3. Text is chunked and embedded, then stored in the vector database.
4. User queries are processed, relevant chunks retrieved, and passed to the LLM.
5. LLM generates responses, which are presented to the user via the frontend.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Copyright Compliance**: Ensure the application respects copyright laws for research papers.
- **Privacy**: Implement measures to protect user data and search history.
- **Bias Mitigation**: Regularly audit the system for potential biases in summarization or analysis.

## Conclusion

This RAG application aims to revolutionize how researchers interact with scientific literature, saving time and enhancing comprehension of complex research papers across various disciplines.
